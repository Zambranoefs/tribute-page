            <p>José Gregorio Hernández, known as the "Doctor of the poor" and also the "servant of God", is a historical-spiritual figure of great relevance to millions of people. <a href="https://www.romereports.com/en/2020/06/19/pope-announces-beatification-of-venezuelan-doctor-jose-gregorio-hernandez/" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">His elevation to “blessed”</a> of the Catholic Church opens a new stage in his legacy.</p>
        
            <p>The beatification decree was signed by Pope Francis after a 71-year wait.</p>

            <p>The announcement was released on the day of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (of which the academic and scientist was devoted) and on the anniversary month of his death, 101 years ago (1919).</p>

            <p>These are some facts about this great human being:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Dr. José Gregorio Hernández was born on October 26, 1864, in a peasant town called Isnotú (Trujillo state, Vzla). He was the eldest of six brothers. Her parents were Benigno Hernández and Josefa Antonia Cisneros. </li>
                <li>From a very young age he showed his love for science and sacred history books. When he moved to Caracas, he began his studies at the Colegio Villegas, one of the most prestigious centers of the time. He was precocious and very intelligent.</li>
                <li>He wanted to be a lawyer but his father convinced him to study medicine. He graduated with the highest grades of his promotion at the Central University of Venezuela (UCV) in 1888. He was a companion of the also famous Venezuelan doctor Luis Razetti.</li>
                <li>During the student days, given his difficult financial situation, he learned from a tailor friend how to make suits; made several for himself. He wrote 5 literary works, 4 of which were published in the prestigious Venezuelan magazine "El Cojo Ilustrado."</li>
                <li>Due to his academic merits, in 1889 the President of Venezuela (Juan Pablo Rojas Paúl) awarded him a scholarship to study at the University of Paris: Microscopy, Bacteriology, Normal, Pathological Histology and Experimental Physiology.</li>
                <li>Upon returning from Paris, he decided to practice his profession in his hometown of Isnotú. He did not charge for his services and was very religious. He is also known as "the doctor of the poor". He would visit his patients on horseback in different Andean towns.</li>
                <li>After spending time practicing medicine in rural areas of the Venezuelan Andes, he returned to Caracas. He was already known and respected for his altruistic work and love of neighbor. Always closely linked to the church, demonstrating an unusual devotion to God.</li>
                <li>He brought to Venezuela the first microscope to the country and other modern equipment that was installed at the Vargas Hospital. He founded the chair of Histology, Physiology and Bacteriology of the UCV Faculty of Medicine. He gave theoretical-practical classes, was punctual, demanding and sarcastic.</li>
                <li>He tried to become a priest twice. In 1908 he was admitted to a monastery in Italy (Tuscany), but after a few months he showed symptoms of a respiratory illness and returned to Caracas. A second attempt at a Roman seminary in 1913 ended in the same way.</li>
                <li>He was founder of the chair of Pathological Anatomy at the Central University of Venezuela. For 27 years he carried out his work in this institution. Through his work "Elements of Bacteriology" (1906), he was the first scientist to write on the subject in Venezuela.</li>
                <li>He was fluent in Spanish, French, German, English, Italian and Portuguese (he understood Latin). Since 1974 the National Academy of Medicine of Vzla has had a scholarship in honor of his work. Scholarship recipients are sent to study in England (Oxford and Cambridge)</li>
                <li>He died on June 29, 1919, on the anniversary of his graduation as a doctor and a day after the signing of the Treaty of Versailles (end of the First World War). He was hit by a 1918 Essex car.</li>
